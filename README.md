# Calculator
A simple calculator app for android devices

The app has 2 flavors, one free and one premium

  - Free
  
  The free flavor gives you basic operations like ```addition```, ```substraction``` and ```multiplication```

  - Premium
  
  The premium flavor gives you more functionality:
    + Being able to clear the screen
    + ```division```
    + ```remainder of division```

This isn't meant to be a production app, it's just an exercise to practice android product flavors and android development in general
